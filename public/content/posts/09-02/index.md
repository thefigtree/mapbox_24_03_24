## Denisovan - The Man from Water

Before the concept of nations and borders was created, the Homo Sapien like birds and fishes roaming their environment freely from Africa to the Caucasus to Scandinavia and Asia. 

However, life was a struggle for the early historic man and woman until the meeting of Homo Sapien and Aqua Sapien at the Altai mountains. 

The child of Homosapien and Aqua Sapien is the hybrid Denisovan with their advanced mathematics, music; as astronomy capability.

Denisovan are the first group of humans to create a musical instrument, the flute, probably the ancestor of the Egyption pharaohs who architected three Great Pyramid of Giza. 

Maybe by no coincidences that the letter M in Latin originated from ancient Egyptian letter for water. 

Sounds has interesting and mysterious effects on human brains. Showering under a waterfall is probably human’s first music experience.

Any creative people know that letting your mind wander in a long shower has miraculous effects on generating new creative ideas as well as breaking through mental roadblocks.

The Altai mountains meaning the mountain of gold is also the birthplace of Bronze-Copper base weapon in 2100 BC as well as massive migration from this area Westward to the Baltic sea and Southward to Southern China. 

The Hun, their horse-based nomads and its famous leader Attila also trace their origin back to the Altai mountains.

At 1965, during the American escalation in Vietnam, a rare and unusual sword was found in a tomb in China. 

Despite being well over 2,000 years old, the sword, known as the Goujian, did not have a single trace of rust.  

The blade drew blood when an archeologist tested his finger on its edge, seemingly unaffected by the passage of time

The Sword of Goujian has 8 characters that has been deciphered as King of Viet.

Maybe the Hoan Kiem lake meaning “the Returning of the Sword” lake in the central of Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam is a wish for one day the Goujian sword would return to its ancient owner. 

Maybe in 21 century we will see the return of bronze-based weapons again but this time copper is going to be used as the conductor for electricity.
